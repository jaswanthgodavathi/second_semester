High quality rooms (there was even a tv by the shower), and high quality service. Also, they are one of few hotels that allow people under 21 to book a reservation.</p>

                        <p> Beautiful downtown hotel with nice roof top bar. Rooms have historic feel with old hard wood floors, yet modern as bathrooms have white subway tiles with TVs in each bathroom. Staff is wonderful and accommodating providing upgrades when available.</p>
